This repository contains most of my scripts that I once wrote for my own
use, but I feel like sharing them with everyone else now, even if they
might not bring so much of a use.

Every script is documented (see script file headers). All scripts that
have #!/bin/sh shebang are POSIX-compliant, those that don't have it
should be executed by the corresponding shell (by executing file itself
and not passing it as an argument to bash/zsh/ksh.)
